Enhanced User Experience: Elevate the customer experience by simplifying the order placement process, applying promotions seamlessly, and providing easy access to order history through an intuitive online interface.
Operational Efficiency: Provide staff members with user-friendly dashboards for managing orders and customer interactions, thus improving overall operational efficiency.

Adaptability: Ensure the system's flexibility to accommodate future changes, additions, and customizations to the menu and promotional items.

The project's significance lies in its capacity to empower Slice of Asia with an efficient online management system. This system not only improves the customer experience but also optimizes restaurant operations.
